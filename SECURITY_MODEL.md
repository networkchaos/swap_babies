# 🔒 Security Model - Swap Babies CLI

## 🛡️ **Deployment Security (Only You Can Deploy)**

### **Who Can Deploy Contracts:**
- ✅ **ONLY YOU** - Requires your private key
- ❌ **Users CANNOT deploy** - No access to deployment scripts
- ❌ **Public CANNOT deploy** - No deployment permissions

### **Deployment Process:**
```bash
# Only YOU can run this (requires your private key)
deploy-live.bat

# Users CANNOT run this - they don't have your private key
```

### **What Happens During Deployment:**
1. **You deploy contracts** with your private key
2. **Contracts are deployed** to mainnets (Celo, Ethereum, Base)
3. **You become the owner** of all contracts
4. **Project fees are set** to your address: `0x33741cA127Df8256bDB24cD0f7B7aE91cdB6536a`
5. **Users connect to YOUR contracts** - they cannot deploy their own

## 🎯 **User Access (Users Can Only Use Features)**

### **What Users Can Do:**
- ✅ **Buy crypto** using M-Pesa
- ✅ **Connect to YOUR contracts** (pre-deployed)
- ✅ **Pay fees** to your addresses
- ✅ **Receive tokens** in their wallets

### **What Users CANNOT Do:**
- ❌ **Deploy contracts** - No private key access
- ❌ **Change fees** - Fees are hardcoded in contracts
- ❌ **Change project wallet** - Address is hardcoded
- ❌ **Execute swaps directly** - Only you (owner) can execute
- ❌ **Access your funds** - No access to your wallets

## 💰 **Fee Structure (All Fees Go to You)**

### **From Every Transaction:**
- **Platform Fee**: 1% → Your platform wallet
- **Project Fee**: 0.5% → `0x33741cA127Df8256bDB24cD0f7B7aE91cdB6536a`
- **M-Pesa Fee**: ~1% → Safaricom
- **Network Gas**: Varies → Network validators
- **User Receives**: ~97.5% of their KES value

### **Revenue Example:**
- 100 transactions/day × 200 KES = 20,000 KES
- Your project fee: 20,000 × 0.5% = 100 KES/day
- Your platform fee: 20,000 × 1% = 200 KES/day
- **Total daily revenue: 300 KES**
- **Monthly revenue: ~9,000 KES**

## 🔐 **Smart Contract Security**

### **Owner-Only Functions:**
```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() { require(msg.sender == owner, "owner"); _; }

// Only YOU can execute these functions
function swapUSDCForTokenAndSend(...) external onlyOwner
function swapUSDCForETHAndSend(...) external onlyOwner
function swapETHForTokenAndSend(...) external onlyOwner
function setProjectFeePercent(...) external onlyOwner
function setProjectWallet(...) external onlyOwner
```

### **Hardcoded Security:**
- **Project Wallet**: `0x33741cA127Df8256bDB24cD0f7B7aE91cdB6536a` (cannot be changed by users)
- **Fee Percentages**: 0.5% project, 1% platform (cannot be changed by users)
- **Owner**: Set during deployment (cannot be changed by users)

## 🚀 **Deployment Workflow**
